This `/docs` directory serves as documentation, an example of how to use this project, and a good set of notes for tests. Three in one!

If you're viewing this in GitHub, it's important to remember that what you are seeing is _not_ how the rendered page would necessarily look! While GitHub supports a lot of Markdown features, it doesn't necessarily support all of the features that this project supports.

This directory is a valid [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault. If you're an Obsidian user, go ahead and open it locally, if you like. Everything should work as expected.
